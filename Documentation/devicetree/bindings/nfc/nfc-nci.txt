Qualcomm QCA199x NFC NCI device

Near Field Communication (NFC) device is based on NFC Controller Interface (NCI)

Required properties:

- compatible: "qcom,nfc-nci"
- reg: NCI i2c slave address.
- qcom,dis-gpio: specific gpio for hardware reset.
- qcom,irq-gpio: specific gpio for read interrupt.
- qcom,clk-src: nfc clock source ("BBCLK2", "RFCLK3", "GPCLK", ...)
- qcom,clk-en-gpio: msm gpio clock,used ony if clock source is msm gpio
- interrupt-parent: Should be phandle for the interrupt controller
                    that services interrupts for this device.
- interrupts: should contain the NFC interrupt. NFC has one read interrupt.
- qcom,clk-gpio: pmic gpio on which bbclk2 signal is coming.

Example:

	i2c@f9925000 { /* BLSP1 QUP3 */
	    nfc-nci@0e {
	        compatible = "qcom,nfc-nci";
		reg = <0x0e>;
		qcom,irq-gpio = <&msmgpio 21 0x00>;
		qcom,dis-gpio = <&msmgpio 20 0x00>;
		qcom,clk-src = "BBCLK2";
		qcom,clk-en-gpio = <&msmgpio 0 0x00>;
		interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
		interrupts = <21 0>;
		qcom,clk-gpio = <&pm8226_gpios 3 0>;
	    };
	};
